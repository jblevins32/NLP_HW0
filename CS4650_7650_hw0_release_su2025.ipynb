    "In this assignment, you will be implementing different evaluation methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) across three key tasks: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), Machine Translation (MT), and Short Story Generation (SSG). \n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks are intended to be ascending order of \"open-endedness\". \n",
    "In MCQ, there is a clear notion of a correct answer, and the answer space is constrained to finitely many options. \n",
    "In MT, there are infinitely many correct translations, but the final answer must have the same semantic meaning as the reference sentence. \n",
    "In SSG, the final answer can have different semantic meanings, but some collection of generations may be more desirable (e.g. coherent, diverse) than others. \n",

    "This assignment will cover fundamental evaluation metrics, prompt engineering techniques, and analysis of model performance across each of these different tasks. \n",
